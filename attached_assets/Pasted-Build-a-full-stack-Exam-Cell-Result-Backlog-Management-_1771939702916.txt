Build a full-stack **Exam Cell Result & Backlog Management System** for a college with approximately 1500 students.

The system must allow administrators to upload results, track multiple attempts (regular, supplementary, revaluation), detect backlogs, compute SGPA/CGPA, and generate reports.

Use a clean, modular structure and ensure the app runs fully in Replit.

# 🧱 Tech Stack

* Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
* Backend: Node.js + Express
* Database: PostgreSQL (use Prisma ORM)
* Authentication: JWT
* File uploads: multer
* Charts: Chart.js

---

# 📁 Project Structure

Create the following structure:

/app
/client   → React frontend
/server   → Express backend
/prisma   → schema.prisma
/uploads  → uploaded result files

---

# 🔐 Admin Authentication

Create secure admin login:

* Email & password login
* bcrypt password hashing
* JWT authentication
* Protected dashboard routes

# 📤 Admin Upload Module

Allow admin to upload result files (CSV or Excel).

### Upload form fields:

* Exam Type: REGULAR | SUPPLY | REVALUATION
* Academic Year
* Semester (e.g., 3-1)
* Branch
* Regulation

Store uploaded file in `/uploads`.

Parse file and extract:

* Roll Number
* Student Name
* Subject Code
* Subject Name
* Grade
* Credits

# 🧠 Attempt-Aware Result Logic

Each subject result is an attempt.

When new results are uploaded:

1. Find student & subject.
2. Set previous attempts `isLatest = false`.
3. Insert new attempt with:

   * attemptNo = previous attempts + 1
   * isLatest = true
4. Determine backlog:

   * Grade F, ABSENT, or credits = 0 → BACKLOG

# 🗄️ Database Schema (Prisma)

Create models:

## Student

* id
* rollNumber (unique)
* name
* branch
* batch
* regulation

## Subject

* id
* subjectCode
* subjectName
* credits
* semester
* branch

## Result

* id
* studentId
* subjectId
* semester
* academicYear
* examType
* attemptNo
* grade
* gradePoints
* creditsEarned
* status (PASS/BACKLOG)
* isLatest
* createdAt

## SemesterSummary

* id
* studentId
* semester
* sgpa
* backlogCount
* creditsEarned

## CumulativeSummary

* studentId
* cgpa
* totalCredits
* totalBacklogs

---

# 🧮 SGPA & CGPA Logic

SGPA =
sum(gradePoints × credits) / sum(credits)

CGPA =
use only latest attempts across all semesters.

# 📊 Dashboard Features

## 1️⃣ Student Search

Search by roll number and display:

* Name
* Branch
* SGPA per semester
* CGPA
* Total Credits
* Backlog count
* Subject-wise results
* Attempt history

---

## 2️⃣ Backlog Reports

Filters:

* Branch
* Semester
* Academic Year

Display:

* Student backlog counts
* Backlog subjects
* Total backlogs per branch

---

## 3️⃣ Analytics Dashboard

Charts:

* Branch-wise backlog distribution
* Pass percentage
* Most failed subjects
* Top performers

---

# 📤 Export Features

Allow exporting reports to:

* CSV
* Print-friendly format

---

# ⚡ Performance Requirements

* Support 1500+ students
* Use database indexes on rollNumber and studentId
* Precompute summaries after uploads

---

# 🧠 Order Independence

System must correctly handle:

* Uploading semesters in any order
* Supplementary uploaded before regular
* Revaluation uploaded anytime

---

# 🔐 Data Integrity

* Prevent duplicate results
* Maintain attempt history
* Log upload history

---

# 🚀 Deliverables

Generate:

* Working full-stack app
* Prisma schema & migrations
* API routes for upload, search, reports
* React dashboard with tables & charts
* Attempt-aware result handling
* Backlog report generation

The application must run successfully inside Replit with clear setup instructions.
